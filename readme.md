# BUDDIES WITH ME v2.2

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) - [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3894)

---------

## Introduction
This mod adds a page to the Profile area under **Buddies/Ignore List** that lists everybody that lists you as a buddy.  Note that you cannot remove someone from their buddies list!

This mod also adds a resync function to the Admin area under **Forum Maintenance**, under **Members**, in the event the Buddies With Me table ever becomes unsynced.

## Potential Issue
After installation is successful, the script must call the resync function in order to build the table.  If this does not happen, then the proper results won't be seen.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 1, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

## Changelog
The changelog has been removed and can be seen at [XPtsp.com](http://www.xptsp.com/board/index.php?topic=9.msg134#msg134).
