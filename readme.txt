[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod adds a page to the Profile area under [b]Buddies/Ignore List[/b] that lists everybody that lists you as a buddy.  Note that you cannot remove someone from their buddies list!

This mod also adds a resync function to the Admin area under [b]Forum Maintenance[/b], under [b]Members[/b], in the event the followers table ever becomes unsynced.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Potential Issue[/u][/size][/b][/color]
After installation is successful, the script must call the resync function in order to build the table.  If this does not happen, then the proper results won't be seen.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.8, and may work on SMF 2.0 and later.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported!

DO NOT attempt to uninstall v1.1!!  Upgrade capabilities were mistakenly included in v1.1 and did not include any functionality changes from v1.0 (and 1.0a).  v1.2 fixes this!!!
